# freeCodeCamp - Back End Development and APIs - Projects - I - Timestamp Microservice


## 1. Projects - Timestamp Microservice

This is the boilerplate code for the Timestamp Microservice project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

  *  Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
  *  Use our Replit starter project to complete your project.
  *  Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

If you use Replit, follow these steps to set up the project:

  *  Start by importing the project on Replit.
  *  Next, you will see a .replit window.
  *  Select Use run command and click the Done button.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.

Note: Time zones conversion is not a purpose of this project, so assume all sent valid dates will be parsed with new Date() as GMT dates.
